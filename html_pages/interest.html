        One of my favorite new stories is that told by <em>Tatsuki Fujimoto</em> in <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>.
        The plot is that when his father died, Denji was stuck with a huge debt and no way to pay it back. Thanks to a Devil dog he saved named Pochita, he's able to survive through odd jobs and killing Devils for the Yakuza. Pochita's chainsaw powers come in handy against these powerful demons.
        Denji is the main of Chainsaw Man. As a young boy, he inherits his father's debts from the Yakuza. After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. Once the Yakuza, under the control of a Devil, betray him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He now becomes the <strong>Chainsaw Devil</strong> by pulling a cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter.
