    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Gerardo Bolanos, born and raised in southern California and this is my last semester at CSUS where Iâ€™ll be graduating with a major in Computer Science. My goals for this course are to freshen up a bit of my Front End development skills. Currently I work full as a Software Engineer at a local software company where my main focus is on the back end. On my free time (what little there is of during school) I enjoy playing pick-up basketball, watching anime, sports and playing some video games!
